### How to start frontend

1.  Open two **NEW** terminals and go to the project folder
2.  In both terminals go to the frontend folder using `cd frontend`
3.  In one terminal use the following commands:
       *    `set FLASK_APP=huw.py`
       *    `python -m flask run`
4.  In the other terminal use the following commands:
       *    `set FLASK_APP=huw_recommend.py`
       *    `python -m flask run --port 5001`

if this all works it works it wil give you a link to the webpage in the terminal where u started huw.py (http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
